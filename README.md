# SeaLevelPredictor
This project uses linear regression to predict how sea levels will change between now and the year 2050. It takes sea level data from the year 1800 to present date and uses the line of best fit to predict future sea levels, using scipy.stats.



This project was created for the FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python course.



This scatter graph was created with Matplotlib. It shows the average sea level of every year since 1800 and plots two lines of best fit: the lower of the two lines indicates future sea levels if it continued to increase at the same average rate as it has since 1800. The other line, the steeper one, predicts future sea levels if it continues to increase at the average rate since 2000.
